This tool compares the efficiency of hashcat and JohnTheRipper on cracking hashes.

Usage: python3 hashbench.py {md5,sha1,sha-256,sha-512} {bruteforce,bf,wordlist,wl} [-h] [-file FILE] [-rules RULES] [-time TIME]


Positional arguments (required):

argument    |    options    | description
-------------------------------------------
hash        |     md5       | specifies the type of hash the benchmark gets performed on
            |     sha1      |
            |    sha-256    |
            |    sha-512    |
            |   md5crypt    |
-------------------------------------------
mode        |   bruteforce  | specifies the attack the benchmark gets performed on
            |       bf      |
            |    wordlist   |
            |       wl      |
            |     markov    |
==========================================

Optional arguments:

argument            |  type   |   description
-------------------------------------
-h/--help           |   bool  |   show help message and exit
-f/-file            |   str   |   path to a file containing hash(es)
-r/-rules           |   str   |   path to rule file for hashcat and rule name for John, needs 2 arguments
-t/-time            |   int   |   maximum execution time in seconds
-wlf/-wordlistfile  |   str   |   path to wordlist file
-minlen             |   int   |   minimum length of password candidates
-maxlen             |   int   |   maximum length of password candidates
-disablemarkov      |   bool  |   flag to disable markov chains in hashcat (brute force only)

Examples:
To benchmark using the brute force attack:
  python3 hashbench.py md5 bf -f resources/hashes/top10k.md5 -t 30

To benchmark using a wordlist attack with rules:
  python3 hashbench.py md5crypt wl -f resources/hashes/top10k.md5crypt -wlf resources/rockyou.wordlist -r resources/rules/OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule OneRuleToRuleThemAll4 -t 30

To benchmark using a wordlist attack without rules:
  python3 hashbench.py sha1 wl -f resources/hashes/50k.sha1 -wlf resources/rockyou.wordlist -t 15

To benchmark using the markov mode (JohnTheRipper only):
  python3 hashbench.py sha512 markov

A quick word about rules and JohnTheRipper:
In order to use (hashcat) rule files or any other rules you have to specify them in the john.conf in john/run.
To make use of the "OneRule" insert the following:

    [List.Rules:OneRuleToRuleThemAll]
    !! hashcat logic ON
    .include '/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT/FOLDER/resources/rules/OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule'
    !! hashcat logic OFF

    You can alternatively put the rule file in john's run directory, which makes the path easier.
